what i am using to learn GitHub
at the time of this I am 24 it is 12/16/17 I am taking my life in my own hands learning how to code and create. its the first day but I really want this lifestyle. I want a better life where I get paid to code. then I want to take it further and buy back my time learning how to use github is just a necessary step.
